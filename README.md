# CommunityStarter

This Maven project is a Spring boot implementation of a community [Broadleaf Commerce](http://www.broadleafcommerce.org) application. It has many sensible defaults set up along with examples of how a fully functioning eCommerce site based on Broadleaf might work.

## Project Overview

The Community Demo is comprised of 4 individual projects:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » tree -L 1
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── admin
├── api
├── core
├── pom.xml
└── site
```

- `admin` - a Spring Boot application for the Broadleaf admin for catalog management, see completed orders, etc
- `api` - a Spring Boot application that sets up the Broadleaf API endpoints
- `site` - a Spring Boot application that runs the Heat Clinic UI built with Thymeleaf as tradiitional MVC
- `core` a common jar that all other projects depend on, used for common functionality like domain

## Prerequisits:

 - Centos/RHEL 7
 - git
 - java 8
 - maven

### Steps:

**1. Install required packages:**
```
yum -y update && yum install -y epel-release git java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64 wget unzip
```

**2. Install maven:**
 ```
cd /usr/local/src

wget http://apache.ip-connect.vn.ua/maven/maven-3/3.6.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz
tar -xf apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz
mv apache-maven-3.6.0/ apache-maven/

cat <<EOF > /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
# Apache Maven Environment Variables
# MAVEN_HOME for Maven 1 - M2_HOME for Maven 2
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/src/apache-maven
export PATH=/usr/local/src/apache-maven/bin:${PATH}
EOF
source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
```

## Running the projects

You must first do a `mvn package` or `mvn install` from the root to build all of the projects:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » mvn clean install
```

After this completes you can run either `site`, `api` or `admin` by using the Spring Boot Maven plugin with `mvn spring-boot:run`. Example:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » cd site
~/CommunityDemo/site » mvn spring-boot:run

```

If you have a JRebel license you can use the `jrebel` profile to start with the Jrebel agent, using a `jrebel.agent.args` property. Example on OSX:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pjrebel -Djrebel.agent.args='-agentpath:/full/path/to/jrebel/lib/libjrebel64.dylib'
```

We recommend moving the `jrebel.agent.args` property into your global `~/.m2/settings.xml` file so that you can just start the application with:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pjrebel
```

For more information on which agent to use for your operating system, [consult the Jrebel documentation](https://manuals.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/standalone/springboot.html#springboot).

### Active Ports

Each project by default starts up with different remote debug ports and HTTP/HTTPS connector ports:

- `site`
  - base url: https://localhost:8081
  - http - `8080`
  - https - `8081`
  - remote debug port - `8000`
- `admin`
  - base url: https://localhost:8083/admin
  - http - `8082`
  - https - `8083`
  -  - `8001`
- `api`
  - base url: https://localhost:8085/api
  - http - `8084`
  - https - `8085`
  - remote debug port - `8002`

## Deploy to Artifactory

To deploy build artifacts through Artifactory you need to add a deployment element with the URL of a target local repository to which you want to deploy your artifacts. Please, use next next configuration example:
```
<distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>snapshots</id>
        <name>e6f37d2755ed-snapshots</name>
        <url>http://83.170.112.143:80/artifactory/libs-snapshot-local</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```
Distribution management acts precisely as it sounds: it manages the distribution of the artifact and supporting files generated throughout the build process.

### Repository

Where as the repositories element specifies in the POM the location and manner in which Maven may download remote artifacts for use by the current project, `distributionManagement` specifies where (and how) this project will get to a remote repository when it is deployed. The repository elements will be used for snapshot distribution if the snapshotRepository is not defined.
